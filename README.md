Toward HyperDrupal: Maturing REST on Drupal

This repository contains the reveal.js deck used to present the Toward HyperDrupal
presentation that began as a humble blog post on my blog. My goal is to be a part
of educating the Drupal community to understand and conform to the constraints of
REST to develop more evolvable and interoperable APIs.

Starting with a look at how the World Wide Web works, we identify the underlying
technologies and their constraints and apply them to web service API design.
These are the URI, HTTP, and Hypermedia (e.g. HTML).
