Toward HyperDrupal: Maturing REST on Drupal
-------------------------------------------

This repository contains the [reveal.js](https://github.com/hakimel/reveal.js) deck
used to present the Toward HyperDrupal presentation that began as a humble blog post
on my blog. My goal is to be a part of educating the Drupal community to understand
and conform to the constraints of REST to develop more evolvable and interoperable
web services.

Starting with a look at how the World Wide Web works, the presentation identifies
the underlying technologies and their constraints and applies them to web service
API design. These are the foundational components of REST APIS - the URI, HTTP,
and Hypermedia (e.g. HTML).
